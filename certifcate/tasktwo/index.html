        "At the 2022 VMAs, Swift announced her recently released 10th original studio album, Midnights. The 13-song soundtrack maintains her pop vibes yet she has also found a soft edge to include in the sound. Swift has officially returned and has clearly come back with a new confidence and a lot to say."
